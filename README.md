# Data-Driven-Google-Ads-for-Listing-Sites-Analysis

This project analyzes the performance of Google Ads campaigns for a listing site. The goal of the project is to identify the most profitable channels, categories, and keywords, and to look for insights by analyzing data points on time series graphs. The project also analyzes the impact of geography on performance.

**Quick note on the dataset:**

'cost' is our total ad spends for that particular date.
'Impressions' are the count of people who view our ad
'clicks' are count of clicks on our ad
'prospects' are count of people interested in our product (as marked by sales)
'Payments' are purchases made. Returns on Ad spends are calculated using Payments/Cost.
Each row is cohortised to the date of ad spends so you can compare quality of ad spends.

**The data was analyzed using a variety of methods, including:**

Weekly and monthly reports

Time series graphs

Statistical analysis

**The findings of the project include:**

-The most profitable channel is Capterra, Get App and Software Advice.

-The most profitable keyword is "Club Management."

-The impact of geography on performance is significant.
